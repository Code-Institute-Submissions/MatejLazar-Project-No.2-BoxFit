            <h3>Welcome to BoxFit!</h3>
            <p>
            BoxFit is made to make your Cardio workout challenging and yet fun.
            Within the sessions you will exercise both your brain and your body by
            repeating, memorizing and performing called out combinations.
            </p>
            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
            <p>In the Main Menu there is an option to choose between 3 dificulties:
            Easy, Medium and Hard.
            <p><span class="easy"><b>Easy</b></span> <br>In this session there will be 20 sequences of 3 punch combinations
            randomly called out every 10 seconds for 3 minutes straight.</p>
            <p><span class="medium"><b>Medium</b></span> <br>This session will have 25 sequences of 5 punch combinations randomly
            called out every 10 seconds for the duration of 3 minutes.</p>
            <p><span class="hard"><b>Hard</b></span> <br>The most callenging session that has 30 punch combinations being randomly
            called out after every 10 seconds for 3 minutes.</p>
  
            <h3>Guideline</h3>
            <p>
            Once the difficulty has been chosen, there will be 10 seconds countdown
            before the exercise starts. This is the time to put on the 
            gloves and get into the boxing stance.
            Your task is to slowly tap the bag as the each punch gets called out, memorize
            the combination and perform it in a full speed and power straight after. Return back into the
            starting stance and rest until the next combination begins.
